*Workshop Scheduling:

Administrators can access a scheduling interface where they can create new workshops.
They can specify the workshop title, description, date, time, duration, and maximum number of attendees.
Workshops can be categorized based on topics such as life insurance, health insurance, property insurance, etc.

*Attendee Registration:

Attendees can browse the upcoming workshops and register for the ones that interest them.
They will receive confirmation emails with details about the workshop they registered for.

Reports can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of workshops and make improvements for future sessions.
